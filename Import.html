       you will need to take these steps:</p>

       <h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Choose_an_in-demand_product"></span><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 24pt;">Choose an in-demand product </span></strong><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Unsurprisingly, the first step is to hunt for a <a href="https://www.supplyia.com/how-to-get-cheap-products-from-china/">China cheap product</a> that you have good reason to think will sell well in Nigeria. Usually, the goods needed rather than a want have constant demand because of their nature. So, if you can’t afford to conduct market research, consider goods that everyone needs regardless of their socioeconomic status. </span></p>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">One way of doing this would be to look for the product’s selling prices in your country.</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Which products are popular among Nigerians? Which ones are the local hits? According to import and export statistics, we compiled the following best-selling products import from China to Nigeria for reference.</span></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <h3><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Best-selling products import from China to Nigeria</span></strong></h3>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1 Apparel and footwear </span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The textile and footwear industry is the second largest contributor to <a href="https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nigeria’s manufacturing industry,</a> accounting for 23.3% of its GDP. According to industry insiders, the country’s annual import cost of textiles and ready-made clothing is US$4 billion. In addition, shoes are very scarce locally, and most of them will be imported from China or other countries.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2 Natural soaps</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Different types of natural soaps for </span>washing and toiletries<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are very popular in Nigeria, including shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. In addition, clothing and utensils also need to be cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene. Although the industry is dominated by a small number of operators, they provide a variety of products on different business lines, and the industry is quite fragmented. In addition, this industry is relatively easy to enter, coupled with high demand, so it needs a large number of suppliers to support.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3 Makeup and Beauty Products</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At least nine out of ten Nigerian girls use cosmetics. At present, the industry is growing at an annual rate of 8% to 10%. It is estimated that by 2021, the beauty and care industry in the Middle East and Africa will reach 34.5 billion U.S. dollars. Well-known brands in Nigeria include Mary Kay, Elf, and Black Opal, among others. As long as women exist, cosmetics and beauty products will always be in high demand.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4 Wig products</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nigeria&#8217;s wig market is booming all year round. In Nigeria, wigs range from 1,000 Naira (approximately RMB 33) to 90,000 Naira (approximately RMB 3,000). The cheaper ones are mostly made of plastic or chemical fiber. Because they cannot be cleaned normally, consumers use them for 30 days. I will buy new styles after around, and it is normal for Nigerian women to have 3-5 sets of wigs.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5 Electronic products </span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nigerian market continues to import a large number of electronic equipment. Currently, Nigeria’s electronic product market has a huge gap. Nigeria imports VCDs, computers, refrigerators, DVDs and other electronic products every year, and a considerable part of them are second-hand products. In 2017, Nigeria&#8217;s imports of consumer electronics reached 738 million U.S. dollars. Among them, 311 million US dollars were imported from China, accounting for 42.16%. China is Nigeria’s first import source of consumer electronics.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">6 Generators</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The electricity supply in Nigeria is short and unstable, so the demand for generators is very large. It is not only suitable for rich families, poor people will also buy it. Every year, 60 million people in Nigeria spend about 1.6 trillion naira on generators&#8217; purchase and maintenance. It is estimated that by 2020, Nigeria’s imports of generator sets will increase to about 151.16 billion naira.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">7 Building materials</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, the Nigerian government has invested a lot of money in the field of infrastructure construction, and this industry has become the most attractive industry for investment in Nigeria. The Nigerian construction industry is backward, accounting for only 3.2% of GDP, which is far from meeting the domestic demand for housing and building materials. It is expected that from now to 2020, the Nigerian construction industry will usher in a higher growth rate.</span></p>
       <h5 style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>The highest imports of building materials products in Nigeria are:</strong> </em></h5>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>construction hardware, doors and windows, ceilings, kitchens and bathrooms, and floor materials products. In addition, the category, quality, and price of Chinese building materials are very suitable for the Nigerian market.</em></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">8 Solar Products</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">More than half of Nigeria’s population, and more than two-thirds of the population in rural areas do not have a normal electricity supply. With the development of solar power technology, Nigeria is extremely rich in solar energy resources and is limited by its own manufacturing capacity. The introduction of solar power equipment from other countries to solve the electricity problem is currently the main countermeasure.</span></p>
       <h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">9 Auto parts products</span></strong></h4>
       <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nigeria has roads, population and affordability. It is considered to be the largest potential auto market in Africa. The Nigerian government imports 8 billion U.S. dollars each year. Imported cars in Nigeria are mainly second-hand cars. The demand for new cars is about 75,000 units/year, and the demand for second-hand cars exceeds 150,000 units/year, accounting for 2/3 of the total demand. As the Nigerian government relaxes the restrictions on the age of imported second-hand cars, second-hand car imports will further increase. Therefore, the auto parts market in the upper and lower Nigerian second-hand car industry chain reaches will usher in more opportunities.</span></p>

In addition, Nigeria&#8217;s seaport equipment is relatively advanced, which not only undertakes its own foreign trade but also undertakes the import and export trade of many countries in West Africa.</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Among them, Lagos is the busiest and largest port in West Africa. There are thousands of freighters from dozens of shipping companies loading and unloading goods in this port every year. Most of the goods exported from China to Nigeria are also shipped to Lagos Port.</span></p>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Goods import from China to Nigeria is a common error-prone link for Chinese foreign trade companies. There are many fines and deductions due to <span style="color: #ff0000;">incomplete certificates during customs clearance</span>. </span></p>
       <p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In addition, Nigeria also imposes import bans on certain products, including China&#8217;s large exports of luggage and footwear products to Nigeria. Since September 2005, some products exported to Nigeria have implemented compulsory safety certification, namely SONCAP certification. </span> SONCAP <span style="font-size: 14pt;">certification is a compulsory certification in Nigeria for customs clearance. Nigeria certification (SONCAP certification) consists of two parts: PC certificate (product certificate) and SC certificate (customs clearance certificate). </span></span></p>
